The log entry you provided is similar to the previous one and appears to be from a sendmail server. Here's a breakdown of the information in this log entry:

- `MAWU2PGG`: This might be a unique identifier for the sendmail process or server.

- `sendmail[1555403]`: This indicates that the sendmail program is involved, and the number in square brackets is likely a process ID or some kind of identifier for this specific sendmail instance.

- `38BA47ix1555403`: This is probably a unique identifier for the email message being processed.

- `to=using,sent,s,mailx,mail,chiranjeevi.nagaraju@antechmail.com,A,-`: This portion appears to list multiple recipients separated by commas, and it includes the email address "chiranjeevi.nagaraju@antechmail.com."

- `ctladdr=oracle (1001/1002)`: This indicates the control address or sender address of the message, which is associated with the user "oracle" and a user ID of 1001/1002.

- `delay=00:00:00`: The delay indicates how long the message has been in the queue.

- `xdelay=00:00:00`: This might indicate the extended delay, which seems to be zero in this case.

- `mailer=relay`: This indicates that the mailer being used is "relay," which typically means the email is being forwarded to another server for delivery.

- `pri=240263`: This could be the priority of the email message.

- `relay=[127.0.0.1] [127.0.0.1]`: This indicates the relay server's IP address, which in this case is the loopback address (127.0.0.1). The loopback address refers to the local machine itself.

- `dsn=4.0.0`: This is the delivery status notification (DSN) code, and "4.0.0" suggests a temporary failure.

- `stat=Deferred: Connection refused by [127.0.0.1]`: Similar to the previous log entry, this is the status of the email delivery attempt. It says that the connection to the relay server at 127.0.0.1 was refused, leading to the email being deferred (not delivered at this time).

Just like in the previous case, this log entry indicates a problem with delivering an email, and the issue is related to a connection problem with the relay server running on the local machine (127.0.0.1). Troubleshooting the cause of the connection refusal on the relay server would be necessary to resolve this issue.
